# **MALLARD** - Our Workhorse

`Mallard` is a Dell R750xs and our only brand-new server.

It was bought with `ProSupport` from PFH, this support ends on the **29th of August, 2029**.

Its chassis can support up to 16 hard drives and 8 NVMes, and takes up 2U of space.

It is racked with B21 Dell ReadyRails.

Dell is great at keeping records, and going to the Dell Support webpage, you can search the Service Tag and get full details on the server. The Service tag is in a thin pull-out piece of plastic on the bottom-right of the front plate. **You should NEVER share the service tag.**

It's unique specs are as follows:
