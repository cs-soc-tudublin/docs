# **RUDDY** - One of Three

`Ruddy` is a Dell R630 and was one of 3 identical servers donated by SIG in 2024.

Its chassis can support up to 8 hard drives, and takes up 1U of space.

It is racked with A7 Dell ReadyRails.

Dell is great at keeping records, and going to the Dell Support webpage, you can search the Service Tag and get full details on the server. The Service tag is in a thin pull-out piece of plastic located below the screen on the front plate. **You should NEVER share the Service Tag.**
