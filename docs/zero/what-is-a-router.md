# What is a Router?

Like a server, a router does what it says on the tin, it routes network traffic.

Routers connect networks between eachother, but are primarily used to connect your local network to the internet.

Many modern routers contain built-in Firewalls, VPNs, and more. But at it's very core, it allows you to control what is (or isn't) routed.

The router will allow you to forward ports to devices on the network, allowing you to actually serve content.
