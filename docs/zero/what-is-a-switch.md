# What is a Switch?

A switch allows multiple devices on the same network to connect and communicate.

Switches will usually have multiple ports operating at the same speed, and a few additional ports to run at a faster speed to connect switches to eachother and to the router.

Switches can be configured to control what IPs devices are given, their communication speeds and a lot more!
