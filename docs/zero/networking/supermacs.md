# **SUPERMACS** - Our Router

Supermacs is our Ubiquiti Dream Machine - Special Edition and our core router.

It runs our Sysadmin VPN Wireguard server as well as connecting all our servers to the internet.

It also has a Hard Drive bay, which would automatically operate as a Network Video Recorder (NVR) if a Security Camera was attached to the network.
