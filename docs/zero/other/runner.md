# **RUNNER** - Our Laptop

In place of a KVM, we have a laptop which gives us portability, and a laptop in the case a Sysadmin does not have one.

We call this laptop `Runner` after the species of duck.

Runner is always connected to the Sysadmin VPN as it's primary purpose is managing infrastructure. It has it's own VPN config.

Each sysadmin has a user account on Runner.

## Storage Locations

Runner must always be stored in one of two locations:

1. CS++ Server Room, Aungier St.
2. CS++ Locker, Grangegorman

The laptop can be taken off-site for events and transit, but may not be stored outside of these locations.

## Specs

Runner is a Dell Inspiron 7590 from ~2019, it is configured as such:

| Item    | Spec                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| **CPU** | Intel i5-9300H               |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA GTX 1050 w/ 3GB GDDR5 |
| **RAM** | 1x 8GB DDR4 @ 2666MHz        |
| **SSD** | 256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Drive    |

Runner does not have an RJ45 port, so to connect over Ethernet, you will need to bring an adapter.

Runner suffers with a bit of a battery life problem, so if you're using it, make sure you bring the charger!
