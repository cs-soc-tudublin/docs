# **WHAT IS A SERVER?** - The First Question

Simply, a server does what is says on the name it 'Serves' content.

Servers are different from Personal Computers (PCs) in a few ways, most importantly it's designed to run multiple programs at the same time and handle high amounts of traffic and highly intensive computational tasks.

Servers are normally very powerful, with a lot of RAM, Storage and even multiple CPUs!

Servers aren't designed to be pretty, or [quiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgXcYp6rn_0). They're designed to work.

Servers are usually mounted into a [Server Rack](https://www.datanet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/full-rack-power-and-specifications-683x1024.jpg). Server Racks normally have networking and server hardware installed.

Servers are build with redundancy in mind and normally have multiple network connections, multiple power supplies and can be remotely accessed and controlled.
