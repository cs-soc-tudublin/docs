# Starboard

[Starboard](https://github.com/RJMurg/FriendConstellation) is an open source web app which allows you to give or remove stars from people / groups.

You can also create tasks that these people can complete.

It is used by the Societies Office during BICS.

It can be found at [stars.societies.ie](https://stars.societies.ie/)
