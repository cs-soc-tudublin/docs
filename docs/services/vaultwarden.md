# VaultWarden

[VaultWarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) is a free and open source version of BitWarden Server.

Written in the Rust programming language, it touts itself as faster, more effecient, and easier to containerise than the standard BitWarden Server.

In CS++, we use VaultWarden to store the passwords for all society-based accounts.

By policy, the VaultWarden is **ONLY** for current Committee on the Society.

Committee members must create an account with their student e-mail.

VaultWarden can be found at [vault.cspp.ie](https://vault.cspp.ie/)
