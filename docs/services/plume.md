# Plume
[Plume](https://github.com/cs-soc-tudublin/Plume) is CS++'s official website. Written in 11ty, and forked from Redbrick's [Atlas](https://github.com/redbrick/atlas), it acts as the face of who CS++ is.
It shows memories of the society, and links to our social media. It also shows the current committee.

It has properly configured CI/CD system through GitHub Actions, so any pushes to `main` will trigger automatic building and deployment.

It can be found [here](https://cspp.ie)
