# MkDocs

MkDocs is this docs page. It is hosted on GitHub pages through CI/CD, and is aliased to [docs.cspp.ie](https://docs.cspp.ie).

This aliasing is done through a `CNAME` DNS record with the value set to `cs-soc-tudublin.github.io`.

As a mission-critical service, these docs are hosted outside of CS++ infrastructure, meaning they can still be accessed if all CS++ infrastructure goes down.
