# **DEBIAN** - Our Virtual OS

There are so many Linux distributions (called 'distros'). Consult [this tree](https://distrowatch.com/images/other/distro-family-tree.png) (Debian is the parent near the bottom). There are approximately 600 distros in active maintenance with over 1,000 known. Of these 1,000+ there are roughly 5 major distros: Arch, Debian, Gentoo, Red Hat and Slackware. These are known as the 'Parent' distros as basically all distros are based off of these. As a matter of fact, Proxmox is based from Debian!

Debian, releasing in 1993 is one of the biggest parent distros in Linux. Spawning spinoffs like Ubuntu, Kali, Mint, `Pop!_OS`, Raspian (For Raspberry Pis), TrueNAS and uncountably more. It is the second oldest Linux distro (Only Slackware is older) and is infamous for its stability and light-weight base install.

## Package Managers and Desktop Environments

Debian uses a Package Manager called `apt` (**A**dvanced **P**ackaging **T**ool)
