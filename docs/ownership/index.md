# Ownership @ CS++

This area covers 'ownership' of CS++'s technical services.

*What is Ownership?*

In CS++, 'Ownership' is the concept of one or more people managing a service, system or object.

After a period of acclimatising themself to the system they own, the Owner should be able to set and find ways to achieve goals related to this system. For a service, this may be uptime or recoverability, for hardware, this may be power-redundancy.

Owners do not have to be experts on the system they own, but should instead be able to guide any growth or work related to the system.

!!! abstract "IMPORTANT NOTICE"

	Just because someone is the 'owner' of the service / area doesn't mean they have to do **ALL THE WORK**. Instead, their aim is to ensure that the goals of the system they 'own' are achieved (I.e. for services this could be uptime, for hardware this could be proper power-redundancy, etc.)

	Owners can fully delegate work as they see fit!

*Why do we do Ownership?*

We use Ownership to ensure that everything we run gets its fair share of attention and maintenance.

Ownership also adds something similar to a tiered structure to the flat-hierarchy of CS++'s System Administrators. While the input and experience from the Sysadmins and the entire committee on a system is good, to maximise speed, focus and 'vision', there should ideally be one or two people managing the decisions on everything.
