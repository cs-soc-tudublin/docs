# *How To*: Use Some Useful Commands

This doc will go over certain useful commands you may use on the infrastructure.

# System Commands

## View System Stats

If you want to view CPU & RAM usage, active processes, and system uptime, run the following command:

```bash
top -i
# -i will hide any inactive processes.
```

It will look something like this:

```
top - 11:52:41 up 57 days,  3:13,  1 user,  load average: 0.24, 0.20, 0.13

## Restarting a Server

When you want to restart a server, run the following command:

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
# -r tells it to restart
# now tells it to do it immediately
```

You will be instantly disconnected as the server shuts down and restarts.

A restart may take a few minutes, so do be patient!

!!! note "After a restart, follow the [restart / unexpected shutdown checklist](./power-loss-checklist.md)!"
