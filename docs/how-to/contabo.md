# *How To:* Use Contabo

[Contabo](https://contabo.com/) is our Cloud hosting provider of choice.

Currently, it hosts [Huey Dewey Louie](../hardware/cloud/huey-dewey-louie.md), our cloud VPS (Virtual Private Server).

This doc will explain what we use Contabo for, and common instructions for duties on Contabo.

This is the Contabo side panel, everything in blue is for *modifying current* stuff, everything in yellow is for *getting new* stuff.

# Controlling a VPS
One of the most common tasks done on Contabo is Controlling a VPS.

First, go to `VPS Control` in the `control panel` section of the side panel.

This will list every VPS owned by the society, and provide common actions for them.

## VPS Controls
![](../res/docs_res/vps_controls.webp)
Above is all actions and information on the VPS that can be seen / done.

## What Do We Normally Press?
Admittedly, not much!

You'll most often go on the VPS Controls to grab a snapshot before doing something which could cause:
- Data Loss
- Downtime

The rest we will normally do through a terminal, such as restarting, starts & stops, etc.

We will VERY VERY rarely modify the specs & addons for the VPS, as this changes the annual cost.

The VPSes are spec'd out (Defining what they will do, what they need to do that, and adding some hardware buffers) before being acquired, so shouldn't need additional changes.
