# **LAYER THREE** - Infrastructure as Code

Now we have services running, that's great! You're actually serving content to the billions of people on the internet.

Once things are actually running, your priorities shift to two things:

1. *How do we maintain what we've already got?*
2. *How do we make it easier to maintain and run new things?*

This section covers **Deploying** our services, **Tasks** and **Jobs** that run manually or automatically, and **Runbooks** which make our lives easier.
