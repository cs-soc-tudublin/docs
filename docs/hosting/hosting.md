# **HOSTING** - Running Websites and More

Welcome! This section of this site covers all you need to know about getting your websites, and more, up and running with CS++.

## **Who Are We?**

CS++ is TU Dublin's Computer Society. We are a student-run society, and want to make clubs and societies in TU Dublin be the best they can be!

## What Can We Host?

We can host almost anything that runs on a computer!

From websites about your club/soc to Minecraft servers, to your password manager, we run anything you want!

Everything we can host is simple to learn and easy to use, and we can even help with training if you want more complicated things

Not sure where to start? We'd love to help, contact us today! [comp@societies.tudublin.ie](mailto:comp@societies.tudublin.ie)

## **Does It Cost Anything?**

Our equipment is funded and maintained through society funding for one purpose, *letting you do great things*. Hosting your stuff with CS++ is entirely free and always will be!

## What Should We Have as a Club/Soc?

### A Website

The first place to start is having your own website! This lets you show your best side and keep your members up to date, or make it easy for them to get photos and videos from events and see who is on your committee

We make it as simple as possible by giving you a Wordpress website, which is both easy to use, and widely supported

Wordpress comes with lots of free add-ons which let you add the functionality that you want to your site. It also comes with many website templates, so you can have a site that fits your vibe

If you want to get a website up and running with us, check out [this page](./websites.md)!

### A Password Manager

At CS++ we host an industry leading password manager for ourselves.

This stores all our passwords for the soc securely, and allows us to control who in the committee has access to what accounts. No more sharing passwords through texts or Google Docs

It also means onboarding and off-boarding committee is super easy, as well as updating our password every year

The password manager has a secure browser extension and mobile app to make it easy to get the passwords

If you're curious about the password manager we use, you can learn about it [here](https://bitwarden.com/)

To learn how we can run your very own password manager, check out [this page](./passwords.md)!

### Game Server

We love playing games, and want to make it as easy as possible for you to run game nights for your members

Our current list of tested game servers is:

- Minecraft
- Foundry Virtual Table Top (for TTRPGs)
- Grand Theft Auto
- Terraria

This list is always expanding, if a game is missing from the list, reach out and let's see what we can do!

For details on running a game server, check [this out](./games.md)!

### Anything You Want

We give you the flexibility to run stuff with CS++, we want to support you to give your club/soc that online touch!

We're always looking for way to push what we can do further and further!

## Shared Responsibility Model

We want to give you the freedom to do great things, but we also have a few boundaries we have to follow. We have a *Shared Responsibility Model* which helps you know what you're allowed to do. You can read that [here](../shared-responsibility.md).

It's quite long, but in short:

- It can't break the law
- We are responsible for keeping the servers online, working, and secure
- You are responsible for the content you host on our servers, and keeping it secure (It's quite easy!)

You will probably never break these rules, but if you're concerned, you can reach out and we can double check!

## Want to Take the Next Step?

Your best way is to contact us through email at [comp@societies.tudublin.ie](mailto:comp@societies.tudublin.ie)

We can schedule a call or in-person meeting if you'd like!

Even if you're not sure what you want to do, we can give you pointers that may help

We can't wait to help you take the next step
