# **PASSWORD MANAGERS** - No More Spreadsheets

!!! warning "On Pause"

	We are temporarily pausing our ability to host password managers. This will change soon. Please don't forget to check back!

A Password Manager is one of the best ways to streamline and secure your club / soc's online presence.

Using a password manager allows you to have all your passwords stored safely and securely, while only allowing the current committee access to only what they need access to!

## How Secure is 'Secure'?

This is a really big question, and quite a valid one!

Communication between your device and your password manager is encrypted (This means no-one but you and the password manager can read it!)

The passwords are also encrypted and the ONLY way to decrypt them is to use your own password! It's so secure that not even we can decrypt them!

The Password Manager software we offer uses modern encryption used by governments, militaries and the biggest companies on the globe!
