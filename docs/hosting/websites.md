## What Can We Host for You?

Currently we give you a website in one of two ways:

### **OPTION 1** - Wordpress

Wordpress is the most widely used Website platform in the world!

It's very beginner friendly, and beautiful by default.

You design your site by dragging and dropping elements and writing text, super easy!

It comes jam-packed with lots of plugins to give your website any additional features you may need

Some websites designed in Wordpress:

- [Georgina Bexon](https://georginabexon.com/)
- [TU Dublin Photosoc (Work in Progress)](https://photo.societies.ie/)

### **OPTION 2** - Custom Programmed

Some people may wish to hand-write their own site. We can also support this!

We can support standard static sites, as well as web applications!

This option can also have automatic deployment pipelines setup so when you make a change in code, it is automatically deployed in less than 2 minutes!

Some websites that are hand-made:

- [CS++ Site](https://cspp.ie)
- [Ruán's Personal Site](https://rjm.ie)
- [UCD Netsoc's Site](https://netsoc.com)
