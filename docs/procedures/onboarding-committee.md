# **ONBOARDING** - All Committee

Committee onboarding is a multi-step process where both we have to get them added to the correct channels, portals, etc. but also to get their onboarding recognised by the office.

## **EMAIL** - Start of the Paper Trail

Send an email to the student email of the member that has just joined the committee to begin onboarding!

**Subject Line:**

```
Welcome to CS++! - Your Onboarding Email
```

**Body:**

```
Welcome {{name}} to CS++!

On behalf of the entire committee, I'd like to extend a massive congratulations on your election to CS++

We have to do a little on-boarding to get you into our secret channels and get you put on our website, cspp.ie!

This e-mail is a little long, but we've tried to organise everything as clearly as possible for you.

We've attached your election photo *and* the photo of the whole committee, feel free to post these wherever you want!

You will have to reply to this email with a few things!!!! Please read carefully. For each step, the full list of things you need to send will be at the __END OF THE EMAIL__!

If you're getting lost, that's okay! We're more than happy to help :) I have a bad habit of writing long emails...

# STEP 1 - Committee Channels
We do all of our communications & committee planning on Discord.
You will need to have a Discord account to do this, you can create one [here](https://discord.com)

Once you have an account (or log into your current one), please go to discord.cspp.ie in a browser and join the CS++ Society Discord, enter your Student Number to be verified. You will eventually be given the Committee Role on Discord when you send your Discord username.

# STEP 2 - The Website & Socials
Each Committee Member gets their name, a photo of their choice, and a custom username to go on the official 'Meet the Committee' section of our custom website, and our Instagram / LinkedIn post!

You need to send us a few things for this, see these at the bottom!

# STEP 3 - Socs Portal

I know we're emailing you to your student email, but we just wanna get everything right, so to add you as committee to the portal, send us your student number!

Being on the portal lets everyone see your name, you can add events, take attendance and get reimbursed for any expenses!!!

# STEP 4 - Registering With the Office

This is something you absolutely HAVE to do. The socs office will not reimburse you or respond to your emails if you aren't registered with them! You can do that [here](!replace with form of this year!).

If you run into issues, let us know and we can help!
The date for your AGM is 09/10/2025

Please reply to this email confirming that you have submitted the registration form

**WHAT TO REPLY TO THIS EMAIL WITH:**
Step 1:
- Your Discord Username

Step 2:
- The name you want used (I.e. Ruán Murgatroyd)
- A photo you are comfortable going on the website & social media (See my photo)
- A custom username you want to appear on the website (It doesn't have to be your social media handle! I use @rjm for CS++)
- Your course & year
- Up to 2 fun facts about yourself!
  
Step 3:
- Your student number
  
Step 4:
- Confirmation of you completing the registration form
```

We normally take photos of those who have joined the committee and a final full committee photo, don't forget to attach them!

## **REPLY** - Getting Things Done

Once they reply with everything attached it's time to get them added to all they need

### **PORTAL** - Molasses+

Go to the Student Life Portal, log in, go to the CS++ Dashboard, click 'Committee' and 'Add Committee'. 

Set the correct role and make sure it is set to 'active'!

### **WEBSITE** - Plumage

This will probably be done by a Sysadmin but they will take their chosen name, image and username to put on the website.

Do not forget to add their names to the wordlist so it doesn't fail the Spellcheck voters

Resize the image so it's about 500px across or less, and convert to webp!
