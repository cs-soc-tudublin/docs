## CS++ Docs

Welcome to CS++'s documentation!

This is where all of our public documentation relies.

We write our docs along a 'layer' style. Each layer builds atop the ones below it to completely describe our infrastructure. Starting at the hardware layer, and finishing with 'Paving', how we deploy our services. This allows us to build a complete knowledge-base to train Sysadmins and support our members!

!!! note "No Prior Knowledge Needed!"

	These docs are written with the assumption that you have never done any kind of System Administration before!

	As such, we try keep explanations simple, provide extra reading where needed, and show what outputs should look like when you run commands!

	Feel free to ask for help from others, or look up what you need!

This is mostly intended for the sysadmins / core committee. But feel free to read up on how we roll.

## For Committee, Sysadmins and the Curious

*Where should I start?*

If you're looking to start from the very beginning, consider [**LAYER ZERO** - Servers, Server Components and Networking](zero/index.md).

Or, if you're curious on our approach to writing our docs, you can read that [here](./docs-vision.md)

Otherwise, browse around!
