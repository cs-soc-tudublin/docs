## CS++ Docs

Welcome to CS++'s documentation. This is to keep up to date information about the technical infrastructure of the society.

!!! note "No Prior Knowledge Needed!"

	These docs are written with the assumption that you have never done any kind of System Administration before!

	As such, we try keep explanations simple, provide extra reading where needed, and show what outputs should look like when you run commands!

	Feel free to ask for help from others, or look up what you need!

This is mostly intended for the sysadmins / core committee. But feel free to read up on how we roll.
