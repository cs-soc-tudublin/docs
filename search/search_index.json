AI, Video and Simulation Workloads","text":"<p>If you're building a Video Rendering server, Physics Simulating or AI server, your primary focus will be your GPU. GPUs are primarily for graphical processing, but are exponentially faster at Vector mathematics and Parallel Processing when compared to CPUs.</p> <p>GPUs really shine in AI, Video and Simulation workloads (Among other things), so some servers have a GPU installed to fulfil this purpose.</p> <p>GPU:</p> <p>Workloads which require a GPU have gotten incredibly resource heavy in the last few years, so normally when specing a GPU server, your GPU(s) will be your most expensive part(s) by far, as being close to the bleeding edge is important to not having to upgrade / retire the hardware early.</p> <p>CPU:</p> <p>You will still need a powerful CPU as networking and Disk operations are handled by the CPU, but since the majority of the requirements go to the GPU, you can relax the requirements here.</p> <p>RAM:</p> <p>All of these workloads usually have very large datasets to go with it, so a significant amount of RAM is recommended. GPUs have their own VRAM (Video RAM), but the standard RAM will usually be used when downloading and uploading the data to and from the server.</p> <p>Storage:</p> <p>As stated above, datasets for these workloads tend to be quite large. So large amounts of high-speed onboard storage is a must-have.</p> <p>This storage does not have to be bleeding edge, but should be quite roomy.</p> <p>Networking:</p> <p>Like the High-Performance Compute example above, you'll want speeds that match your network speeds, and especially your internet speed.
