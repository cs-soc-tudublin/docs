But you want to add extra time as more services and hardware will appear over the lifetime of the UPS. I tend to round up to the nearest 15/20 minutes.</p> <p>You will need a UPS which can output 5,000W for 15 minutes. So, that's 5,000W/4 (As watts are the measurement of power over the time of 1 hour, don't think about it too hard.)</p> <p>Your minimum UPS size is 1,250VA</p>","tags":["zero","hardware","power"]},{"location":"zero/what-is-a-ups/#superpowers-ups-configurations","title":"SUPERPOWERS - UPS Configurations","text":"<p>UPSes can be configured to wait a set time after mains power is lost before sending the shutdown signal. This is because a lot of power outages are only a few minutes. Then, if the power isn't restored at the timeout, it'll send the shutdown signal.</p> <p>UPSes can also be configured to send a 'Wake on LAN' signal when mains power is restored and stabilised, to automatically restart all the hardware. This is a bit of a double-edged sword, as grid stabilisation after a blackout is more of an art than a science, and successive blackouts can occur.</p> <p>Finally, UPSes can also 'clean' the power. Alternating Current needs to be at a stable frequency, but the frequency after a blackout is often dirty\u00a0\u29c9 and not a clean waveform.
